- HTMX form submission
- Inline error messages

### 3. Job Actions (2 hours)
- Start button (HTMX POST)
- Pause button (HTMX POST)
- Delete button with confirmation (HTMX DELETE)
- Button state logic per job status

### 4. Real-time Progress (2-3 hours)
- WebSocket connection on page load

- Update progress bars dynamically
- Update status badges on status change
- Handle disconnection/reconnection

### 5. Crash Recovery (1 hour)
- Detect interrupted jobs on app load

## 💡 Key Insights

### What Worked Well ✅
1. **HTMX is perfect for this use case** - No need for complex JS frameworks
2. **Tailwind CSS speeds up development** - No custom CSS needed
3. **Blueprint architecture** - Clean separation, easy to maintain
4. **Shared business logic** - Zero code duplication with Streamlit
5. **Parallel deployment** - Both apps can run simultaneously

### Challenges Overcome ✅
1. **Port 5000 conflict** - Solved by using port 5001 (macOS AirPlay)
2. **Production config validation** - Fixed by deferring validation
3. **Flash messages with HTMX** - Created reusable partial template
4. **Log file reading** - Implemented efficient last-N-lines reading

### Lessons Learned 📚
1. HTMX `hx-include` is crucial for multi-field filters
2. Debouncing search with `delay:500ms` improves UX
3. Partial templates make HTMX updates cleaner
4. Flask-SocketIO requires `allow_unsafe_werkzeug=True` in dev
