# Rclone Workflow Hardening - Implementation Complete ✅

**Date:** 2025-10-26
**Change ID:** `harden-rclone-workflow`
**Status:** ✅ **IMPLEMENTED**

---

## Summary

Successfully implemented all 5 correctness and operability fixes from the Gemini advisory, converting the `ADVISORY-rclone-workflow-hardening.md` into production code.

## Changes Implemented

### 1. ✅ Rclone Binary Preflight Check
**File:** `core/job_manager.py:165-169`

**What Changed:**
- Added preflight check before creating `RcloneEngine` instance
- Calls `is_rclone_installed()` from utils
- Raises clear `ValueError` with install instructions if rclone missing

**Impact:**
- Clear error: "rclone not found. Install from https://rclone.org"
- Fails fast instead of generic subprocess errors

---

### 2. ✅ Per-File Deletion Retry Bug Fix (CRITICAL)
**File:** `engines/rclone_engine.py:330-358`

**What Changed:**
- `_restart_process()` now checks `delete_source_after` and `deletion_mode`
- Uses `operation = 'move'` when `deletion_mode == 'per_file'`
- Adds `--delete-empty-src-dirs` flag for move operations
- Previously hardcoded to 'copy' which broke per-file deletion on retry

**Impact:**
- Network error retries preserve per-file deletion semantics
- Sources no longer accumulate files after network errors

---

### 3. ✅ Verify-After Mode Implementation
**File:** `engines/rclone_engine.py:261-276`

**What Changed:**
- Added post-transfer verification when `verification_mode == 'verify_after'`
- Runs `_verify_backup()` after successful transfer
- Updates `progress['verification']['passed']` field
- Only runs if NOT already in verify_then_delete mode (avoids duplicate verification)

**Impact:**
- Users can verify backups without enabling deletion
- Verification mode now works independently of deletion settings

---

### 4. ✅ Remote Directory Cleanup
**File:** `engines/rclone_engine.py:569-588`

**What Changed:**
- After successful `rclone delete` on remotes, invokes `rclone rmdirs`
- Logs outcome with clear messages
- Errors are non-fatal (logged as warnings, don't fail job)
- 60-second timeout with exception handling

**Impact:**
- Remote cloud storage no longer accumulates empty directory trees
- S3/GDrive/OneDrive stay clean after deletions

---

### 5. ✅ Unified Data Directory Paths
**Files:** `engines/rclone_engine.py:67-69`, `engines/rsync_engine.py:70-72`

**What Changed:**
- Both engines now use `from core.paths import get_logs_dir`
- Changed from hardcoded `Path.home() / 'backup-manager' / 'logs'`
- Removed redundant `mkdir` calls (get_logs_dir handles this)

**Impact:**
- Rclone and rsync logs now appear in Flask UI Logs page
- Respects `BACKUP_MANAGER_DATA_DIR` environment variable
- Single source of truth for data paths (`core/paths.py`)

---

## Files Modified

| File | Lines Changed | Type |
|------|---------------|------|
| `core/job_manager.py` | +5 | Preflight check |
| `engines/rclone_engine.py` | +30 | Retry fix, verify-after, rmdirs, log paths |
| `engines/rsync_engine.py` | +3 | Log paths |
| **Total** | **38 lines** | **3 files** |

## Testing Recommendations

### Quick Smoke Tests

1. **Preflight Check:**
   ```bash
   # Temporarily rename rclone
   mv $(which rclone) $(which rclone).bak
   # Try to create rclone job in UI - should see clear error
   mv $(which rclone).bak $(which rclone)
   ```

2. **Verify-After Mode:**
   - Set `verification_mode=verify_after` in settings
   - Create job without deletion enabled
   - Run job and check logs for "Running post-transfer verification"
   - Verify `progress['verification']['passed']` is True/False

3. **Log Visibility:**
   - Run any rclone or rsync job
   - Navigate to Flask Logs page
   - Verify logs appear in filter/search

### Full Integration Tests (from tasks.md)

- [ ] Simulate network error during per-file move, verify retry uses move
- [ ] Test remote deletion with test remote, verify rmdirs is invoked
- [ ] Test with custom `BACKUP_MANAGER_DATA_DIR`, verify paths work

## Spec Compliance

All requirements from OpenSpec proposal satisfied:

- ✅ `rclone-retry-correctness` (MODIFIED) - 3 scenarios
- ✅ `rclone-verification-mode` (MODIFIED) - 5 scenarios
- ✅ `rclone-preflight-checks` (ADDED) - 3 scenarios
- ✅ `rclone-remote-cleanup` (ADDED) - 3 scenarios
- ✅ `data-directory-unification` (ADDED) - 6 scenarios

## Risk Assessment

**Actual Risk: LOW**

All changes are:
- ✅ Additive (no existing functionality removed)
- ✅ Defensive (error handling, non-fatal failures)
- ✅ Isolated (small scoped changes)
- ✅ Well-tested patterns (unified paths already used elsewhere)

## Next Steps

1. **Archive OpenSpec Proposal**
   ```bash
   openspec archive harden-rclone-workflow --yes
   ```

2. **Update Specs**
   - Apply all 7 spec deltas to canonical specs
   - Mark advisory as implemented

3. **Production Deployment**
   - No configuration changes required (defaults preserved)
   - Optional: Set `BACKUP_MANAGER_DATA_DIR` if custom location desired

4. **Monitor**
   - Watch logs for "Removing empty directories from remote"
   - Verify no retry failures on per-file jobs
   - Check that verify-after mode logs appear

---

**Result:** All 5 issues from Gemini advisory resolved. Rclone engine is now more robust, user-friendly, and maintainable.
