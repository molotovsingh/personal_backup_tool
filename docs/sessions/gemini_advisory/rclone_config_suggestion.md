# Rclone Configuration Suggestion

This document outlines a proposal for a new feature to simplify the `rclone` configuration process from within the application.

## The Problem

Currently, the application relies on the user to configure `rclone` via the command line. This can be a complex and error-prone process for users who are not familiar with the `rclone` command-line interface.

## The Proposal: A Guided, In-App Walkthrough

Instead of re-implementing the entire `rclone config` process in the UI, which would be very complex, I propose a simpler and more practical solution: a **guided, step-by-step walkthrough** directly within the app's UI.

This feature would provide a user-friendly guide for configuring `rclone` for common providers like Google Drive, without requiring the user to leave the application for instructions.

### How It Would Work

1.  On the **Settings** page, if no `rclone` remotes are configured, the user would see a button like **"ðŸ”— Configure a New Cloud Storage Remote"**.
2.  Clicking this button would open a clear, step-by-step guide. For Google Drive, it would look something like this:

    ### **Configuring Google Drive**

    **Step 1: Open Your Terminal**
    You'll need to run a command in your terminal. The application will tell you exactly what to type.

    **Step 2: Start the `rclone` Configuration**
    Copy and paste the following command into your terminal and press Enter:
    ```bash
    rclone config
    ```

    **Step 3: Follow the Prompts**
    `rclone` will ask you a series of questions. Here are the answers for a standard Google Drive setup:

    *   `n)` (for New remote)
    *   `name>` **`gdrive`** (you can choose another name)
    *   `Storage>` **`drive`** (for Google Drive)
    *   `client_id>` (press Enter for default)
    *   `client_secret>` (press Enter for default)
    *   `scope>` **`1`** (for full access)
    *   `root_folder_id>` (press Enter for default)
    *   `service_account_file>` (press Enter for default)
    *   `Edit advanced config?` **`n`** (for No)
    *   `Use auto config?` **`y`** (for Yes)

    `rclone` will then open a browser window for you to sign in to your Google account and grant permission.

    **Step 4: Finish and Verify**
    Once you've granted permission, go back to the terminal, and `rclone` will confirm the new remote. You can then quit the configuration tool.

    **Step 5: Refresh This Page**
    Click the "Refresh" button below, and your new `gdrive` remote will appear here.

### Benefits

*   **Improved User Experience:** This feature would make the `rclone` configuration process much smoother and less intimidating for users.
*   **Reduced Errors:** By providing clear, copy-and-paste instructions, we can reduce the likelihood of user error during the configuration process.
*   **Practical Implementation:** This approach provides most of the benefits of a full UI-based configuration tool with a fraction of the implementation complexity.

### Next Steps

I recommend implementing this feature on the "Settings" page. This would involve:

1.  Adding a button to the "Settings" page that is shown only when no `rclone` remotes are configured.
2.  Creating a new template or a modal to display the guided instructions.
3.  Adding a "Refresh" button that re-checks the `rclone` configuration and updates the settings page.
