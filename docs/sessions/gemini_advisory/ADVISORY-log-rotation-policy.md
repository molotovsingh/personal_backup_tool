# ADVISORY: Log Rotation Policy Implementation

## Problem

The current logging mechanism writes application logs to files without any rotation policy. Over time, these log files will grow indefinitely, potentially consuming significant disk space and making log analysis difficult.

## Proposal

Implement a log rotation policy to manage log file sizes and retain a reasonable history of logs. This will prevent disk exhaustion and improve the manageability of application logs.

## Implementation Details

We propose using Python's built-in `logging.handlers` module, specifically `RotatingFileHandler` or `TimedRotatingFileHandler`, to manage log rotation.

### Option 1: RotatingFileHandler (Size-based rotation)

This handler rotates logs when the current log file reaches a certain size.

*   **Configuration:**
    *   `maxBytes`: The maximum size in bytes a log file can reach before it's rotated (e.g., 10 MB, 50 MB).
    *   `backupCount`: The number of old log files to keep (e.g., 5, 10).

*   **Example:** Keep 5 backup files, each up to 10 MB.

### Option 2: TimedRotatingFileHandler (Time-based rotation)

This handler rotates logs at specified time intervals (e.g., daily, weekly).

*   **Configuration:**
    *   `when`: The interval type (e.g., "h" for hourly, "d" for daily, "w0" for Monday weekly).
    *   `interval`: The number of intervals.
    *   `backupCount`: The number of old log files to keep.

*   **Example:** Rotate daily, keep 7 days of logs.

### Recommended Approach

Given the potential for high log volume, a `RotatingFileHandler` with a `maxBytes` of `10MB` and `backupCount` of `5` is a good starting point. This ensures that individual log files don't become too large, and we retain a recent history of logs.

### Configuration Location

The logging configuration should be integrated into the application's settings, likely within `core/settings.py` or a dedicated `logging_config.py` module, and applied during application initialization (e.g., in `app.py` for the FastAPI application).

## Benefits

*   **Disk Space Management:** Prevents log files from consuming excessive disk space.
*   **Improved Log Analysis:** Smaller, rotated log files are easier to open, search, and analyze.
*   **System Stability:** Reduces the risk of application instability due to full disk conditions caused by logs.
