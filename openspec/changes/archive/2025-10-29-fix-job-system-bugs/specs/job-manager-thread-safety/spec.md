## MODIFIED Requirements

### Requirement: JobManager ensures thread-safe operations

JobManager SHALL handle concurrent access from multiple threads without race conditions, data corruption, or deadlocks.

#### Scenario: Concurrent read operations do not block

- **GIVEN** multiple threads access JobManager
- **WHEN** threads perform read operations (list_jobs, get_job_status)
- **THEN** operations execute concurrently without blocking
- **AND** all threads receive consistent data snapshots
- **AND** no data modifications occur during reads
- **AND** read performance scales linearly with thread count

#### Scenario: Write operations are serialized safely

- **GIVEN** multiple threads attempt to modify jobs
- **WHEN** concurrent write operations occur (create, start, stop, delete)
- **THEN** operations are serialized with proper locking
- **AND** no race conditions occur
- **AND** state transitions are atomic
- **AND** lock acquisition follows consistent order (prevents deadlock)

#### Scenario: Engine access is thread-safe

- **GIVEN** job engines are stored in shared dictionary
- **WHEN** multiple threads access engines concurrently
- **THEN** engine dictionary is protected by dedicated lock
- **AND** engine operations don't hold lock longer than necessary
- **AND** stale engine references are cleaned up safely
- **AND** no engine is accessed after cleanup
