# Proposal: Add Source Deletion Feature to Flask UI

## Why
The backend engines (rsync/rclone) and Streamlit UI already support source file deletion after successful backup with verification, but this critical feature was not migrated to the Flask UI during the Streamlitâ†’Flask migration. Users who rely on the deletion feature for backup-and-cleanup workflows cannot use the Flask app, creating feature parity issues between the two frontends.

## What Changes
- **Add deletion controls to job creation form**: Checkbox to enable deletion, radio buttons for mode selection ('verify_then_delete' vs 'per_file'), confirmation checkbox for safety
- **Display deletion warnings and safety info**: Show clear warnings about permanent deletion, explain each mode, display enabled safety features
- **Pass deletion settings to backend**: Update job service to accept and validate deletion parameters
- **Show deletion progress in job detail**: Display deletion phase (verifying, deleting, completed), files deleted count, bytes deleted
- **Deletion status indicators**: Show visual indicators when job has deletion enabled (warning badges, special colors)

## Impact
- **Affected specs**: 2 capabilities (deletion-ui-controls, deletion-safety-features)
- **Affected code**:
  - `flask_app/templates/jobs.html`: Add deletion form controls
  - `flask_app/templates/partials/job_detail.html`: Show deletion progress
  - `flask_app/routes/jobs.py`: Handle deletion form data
  - `services/job_service.py`: Validate deletion settings, pass to JobManager
- **Feature parity**: Achieves full parity with Streamlit UI for deletion functionality
- **No backend changes**: Backend already supports deletion, only UI needs updates
- **No breaking changes**: Existing jobs without deletion continue working normally
- **Safety**: Requires explicit user confirmation before enabling deletion
