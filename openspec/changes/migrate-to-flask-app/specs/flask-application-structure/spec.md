# Spec: Flask Application Structure

## ADDED Requirements

### Requirement: Flask application initialization and configuration

The Flask application SHALL be initialized using the application factory pattern with blueprints for each major page. Configuration MUST support development and production environments with appropriate defaults.

**Technical approach:**
- Flask app factory in `flask_app/__init__.py`
- Blueprint-based routing (dashboard, jobs, settings, logs)
- Configuration from environment variables with fallbacks
- Flask-Session for server-side session management
- Flask-SocketIO for WebSocket support

#### Scenario: Flask app starts successfully

**Given** Flask dependencies are installed
**When** the user runs `flask run` or `python flask_app.py`
**Then** the Flask application starts on port 5000
**And** all blueprints are registered correctly
**And** the application serves the dashboard page at http://localhost:5000/
**And** session management is configured
**And** WebSocket connections are accepted

#### Scenario: Configuration loaded from environment

**Given** environment variables are set for FLASK_ENV, SECRET_KEY, SESSION_TYPE
**When** the Flask application initializes
**Then** configuration values are loaded from environment
**And** fallback defaults are used for missing values
**And** sensitive values (SECRET_KEY) are not exposed in logs

#### Scenario: Blueprints registered for all pages

**Given** the Flask application is initialized
**When** the app factory runs
**Then** dashboard blueprint is registered at "/"
**And** jobs blueprint is registered at "/jobs"
**And** settings blueprint is registered at "/settings"
**And** logs blueprint is registered at "/logs"
**And** all routes are accessible

### Requirement: Error handling and logging

The application SHALL provide consistent error handling with user-friendly error pages and comprehensive logging for debugging.

#### Scenario: 404 error displays custom page

**Given** the Flask application is running
**When** a user navigates to a non-existent route (e.g., "/nonexistent")
**Then** a 404 error page is displayed
**And** the page uses the base template with navigation
**And** the page suggests returning to dashboard

#### Scenario: 500 error displays custom page

**Given** an unhandled exception occurs during request processing
**When** the error is caught by Flask's error handler
**Then** a 500 error page is displayed
**And** the error is logged to the application log file
**And** sensitive error details are not exposed to the user
**And** the page offers a way to report the issue

#### Scenario: Request logging captures key information

**Given** a user makes any request to the application
**When** the request is processed
**Then** the request method, path, and status code are logged
**And** response time is logged for performance monitoring
**And** user session ID is logged (if authenticated)
**And** logs are written to the same format as existing logs
